PolyHx 2019 Hackatown Hackathon Andriod App Development Project
We decided to make an app that links tourist with locals.
We attempted to make an andriod app using Andriod Studios which none of us had experience coding in.
We were not able to complete it in the alotted time, however, we learnt the basic features of the application.
